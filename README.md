# docker-dangling-http
A small node webservice to be used under HTTP load test. Use querystring parameters to modify how quickly (or not) the service responds.

### Development
1. Clone repo, `cd docker-dangling-http`
1. Install dependencies, `npm i`
1. Run the app `npm start` or `node index`

### Usage (Docker)

- Available on Docker Hub `bryanlatten/docker-dangling-http`
- `docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 bryanlatten/docker-dangling-http`
- Make HTTP requests against the `docker-machine` IP + port (3000) or `localhost:3000` (linux + docker4mac/win) with the following querystring variables, which may be combined:

Querystring | Name | Example | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
d | Delay | /?d=30 | 0 | Seconds to delay before HTTP response is sent
r | Random | /?r=30 | 0 | Adds time to delay, randomly, up to provided value
e | Empty | /?e=1 | 0 | Prematurely breaks HTTP connection, with empty response

### Example

Note: service is running locally (on `127.0.0.1:3000`) via `npm start`

- Request completed, immediately
```bash
$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000
[Response from 127.0.0.1]
  - not delayed
```

- Request completed, after 30 seconds delay
```bash
$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/\?d=30
[Response from 127.0.0.1]
  - delayed 30s
```

- Request completed, minimum 10 seconds delay, with additional random 5 seconds
```bash
$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/\?d=10\&r=5
[Response from 127.0.0.1]
  - adding 3s random delay (max 5s)
  - delayed 13s
```


- Request ended, broken, after 15 seconds delay
```bash
$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/\?d=15\&e=1
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```

Console log from the above request "broken" confirms:
```bash
Request from ::ffff:127.0.0.1, delayed 15s, prematurely breaking connection
```

### Load testing example

```bash
$ ab -c 3 -n 10 127.0.0.1:3000/\?d=1
```
